        <p>WebUtils is a project to make great apps for the mobile web.</p>

<p>Currently, the mobile app ecosystem is dominated by native. Android and iOS (and a few other people) are busy pushing developers to their own IDEs, runtimes, and in some cases, languages (<em>cough</em> Swift).</p>

<p>But it doesn't have to be this way. Web technology not only runs everywhere (and works pretty much everywhere) but it is now possible to build pretty much fully-fledged mobile apps that run in device's web browsers, and get a native experience.</p>

<p>However, until now, there has been a general trend to build native (even if you already have a web app or mobile-capable web app) for whatever reason. This project aims to change that: by providing guidance, tooling, examples and a community around building apps designed for mobile web browsers.</p>

<p>Browsers on mobile devices are up to it, so let's get busy!</p>

<p>We have a convenient list of all the user-contributed mobile web apps affiliated with the WebUtils project which you can <a href="https://github.com/WebUtils/Platform/wiki/WebUtils">see what we have already</a>.</p>

<h4>
<a name="i-dont-see-what-i-need" class="anchor" href="#i-dont-see-what-i-need"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I don't see what I need!</h4>

<p>Use the Github Issues on the Platform project (<a href="https://github.com/WebUtils/Platform/issues">here</a>) to request new apps. Please provide some content to your suggestion, so it can form the basis of a spec if your idea is picked up! Please also prefix the title with "Request: " and tag it "request-app" so we can find it more easily.</p>

<a name="how-can-i-contribute" class="anchor" href="#how-can-i-contribute"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How can I contribute?</h3>

<p>We're always looking for people to build new apps!</p>

<p>We have constructed the <a href="https://github.com/WebUtils/Platform">WebUtils Platform project</a> to help you along, if you would like to use it. It contains a quickstart and various guides and bits and pieces to help developers build mobile web apps more efficiently.</p>

<p>You don't need to use the WebUtils platform to build your own app. But it's cool if you do! We're here as a helping hand to kick-start things a bit. If you prefer to do something different then do so by all means. <a href="https://github.com/WebUtils/Platform/wiki/WebUtils">Leave a note on the wiki</a> to let us know you have built something cool!</p>

<p>There is a "quickstart" directory in this project you can use as a template, if you wish. If you would like to use Bootstrap too, then I have previously used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/customize/?id=254290f9e9656ac38c73">this cut-down configuration</a> to help with things like buttons and other common reusable components. </p>

<p>If you have any questions about WebUtils, use the #WebUtils hashtag on Google+ (or Twitter, if it's short!) to ask a question. We'll be happy to help! If you have an issue to report with a specific application, please use that project's bug reporting mechanism (usually Github Issues) to report it to them directly.</p>

<p>Of course, there are also a ton of example apps so you can see how others have done it before. Check them out <a href="https://github.com/WebUtils/Platform/wiki/WebUtils">on the wiki</a>.</p>
